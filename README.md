## Cloud Computing Our Team :
* In our local computing environment, cloud technology plays a central role in supporting various aspects of our application. By utilizing cloud computing, we provide APIs that manage content and features such as articles, batik, search, bookmarks and camera. Integration with Data Management (MD) ensures efficient and structured data, while cloud storage is used to store datasets that support our recommendation features powered by Machine Learning. By using Cloud Run as a serverless platform, our infrastructure can automatically self-adjust, provide high availability, and minimize management complexity. Advantages such as automatic scalability, cost efficiency, rapid development, and integrated security make cloud computing a strong foundation for providing an optimal user experience in our applications.
* In our on-premises environment, cloud computing serves as a critical foundation, enabling the implementation of APIs that manage a wide array of features, including Machine Learning-driven content, articles and recommendations, with the efficiency of Cloud Run's serverless platform ensuring scalability and optimal user experience.
* Tools needed:
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Cloud Run
  - Node.js
  - Python
